Hi! I'm Julia. I'm product-strategist, writer, and investigator of interesting questions. I'm working on building a more environmentally sustainable, harmonious, and just world, using thoughtful technology.

I previously was a Product Manager at Meta, building new climate products, tools used by content moderators to tackle harmful speech and misinformation, and engaging VR interfaces to promote discovery. I also have experience working in startups, early-stage investing, and public policy, as they relate to climate tech.

I studied at Harvard and am currently based in San Francisco.

Some things I've made: I [write](https://spectacled-geranium-4fc.notion.site/c6aef6de4a424a2b9f1a8f782cd3ae85?v=964567d0afed4a779e1adc4a90ebf90e&pvs=4) about climate, technology, and culture. I host a climate-tech [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/7n18cv0xsBTLAEdgSOJEcE) and once made podcast [series](https://www.thegoodrushpodcast.com/episodes/episode/2855d4d8/the-tip-of-the-iceberg-climate-finance)  about impact investing and climate with some really smart people.

In my free time, you can find me [making art](https://www.instagram.com/artisf_un/), cycling, and curling up with a good book and a cup of tea. In an earlier life, I was a travel writer, graphic designer, translator, and painter.
