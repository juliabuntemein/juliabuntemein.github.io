At a time when eaters have never been so confused about their food choices, whether they worry about their health or the welfare of animals, opting for fish over other proteins seems like the best bet. Compared to land animals, fish are much more resource efficient, meaning the amount of food needed for their production is not all that different from the amount of fish served on plates. Fish's' omega-3 health benefits also make it a popular consumer choice. Yet so many of us have been making that choice that the fish themselves are in trouble. Over [70%](http://www.pnas.org/content/104/50/19709.full) of the world's marine fisheries are fished to or beyond their sustainable limit, and approximately [90%](http://overfishing.org/pages/why_is_overfishing_a_problem.php) of fish stocks of large predatory fish are already gone. [FAO](http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i2727e/i2727e01.pdf) put total wild capture at 90.4 million metric tons, roughly the equivalent of the weight of the human population of China. With our population expected to rise to 10 billion by 2050, relying on wild caught fish to meet demand is simply not an option.

The solution to this problem would seem to be farmed fishing, the fastest growing form of food production today. A generation ago, most of our fish came from the sea. Today, half the fish we eat is farmed. But aquaculture as we know it is not necessarily much better for the world's fisheries or for our health. Since most farmed fish are fed wild fish, aquaculture doesn't necessarily take the pressure off world fisheries. After factoring in the feed source, waste, and antibiotics, few aquaculture operations have proven to be truly sustainable.

Humans have been raising fish in farms for millennia, dating back 4,000 years ago. But aquaculture as we know it today only arose in the past 50 years. Starting after World War II, ecological theorists saw aquaculture as a potential solution to the protein problem of our century. As the journalist Paul Greenberg writes in his book *Four Fish,* "If done right, aquaculture had the potential to achieve the most elusive goal of animal husbandry -- to produce one pound of flesh for less than a pound of feed," a goal unthinkable for land animals. Yet the agro-industrial models failed one after another - waste proliferated and feed conversion ratios remained sky high. Attempts at increasing efficiency led to overcrowding, disease, and escapes. Aquaculture "became cast in the public mind as a dirty industry with a net protein loss for the world," explains Greenberg.

A Visit To Australis
--------------------

These thoughts were swimming through my head as I opened the door to Australis, a company that believes it can prove decades of failed aquaculture experiments wrong. Inside this building, the company promises, is the fish solution we've all been waiting for.

Though I was here to meet Jonathan Daen, the CFO of Australis who runs the company, it is the vision of his partner Josh Goldman, the CEO. Goldman came to fish from an ecological perspective. Throughout his college years studying aquaculture engineering at Hampshire College, Goldman saw aquaculture attempts fail one after another, sullying the entire industry. In an interview with Paul Greenberg, he said, "I realized we were spending all this effort trying to solve some really difficult problems of domestication on many familiar species. But in our focus on these issues we never asked fundamental questions about the species itself before choosing it. What does it eat? What are its fundamental behaviors? How fast does it grow?"

Goldman decided to take a different perspective -- to work with nature, not against her. He thought that perhaps it is not the model that was the problem, but rather the species. Thus began his epic global mission to find the "miracle fish" whose natural characteristics would fit the aquaculture model. This involved testing over 50 different species before he came upon a strange-looking fish native to the Indo-Pacific region: The Barramundi. She is a prehistoric-looking creature, with a tiny head, protruding lower lip, dark grey and green back fin, and wide silvery flank.

Fish probably aren't the first species that comes to mind when you think of being personable. But for the barramundi, its personality is actually one of the most important things about it. If sea bass is your demanding college roommate that needs her own single and throws tantrums when anyone touches her stuff, the barramundi is the roommate that everyone dreams of -- easy going, doesn't mind living in cramped spaces, and isn't a picky eater. Oh wait, I forgot to mention, barramundi are cannibalistic -- but only if in close quarters with those significantly smaller in size. Accordingly, Australis manages this with extensive size grading to keep them separate. Sorry, but that football player and kid genius roommate combination won't work in college dorms, and it's not going to fly here either.

Surrounded by fish of the same size, however, barramundi won't try to eat each other and are in fact very docile and compliant. These characteristics originate in their nature life cycle patterns. While most fish spawn in fresh water and migrate to the ocean, barramundi do the opposite. But in the process of migrating to fresh water, they often get stuck in billabongs, areas of rivers that get cut off during the dry seasons and become stagnant. And what are billabongs if not natural aquaculture tanks? The confined farm environment is therefore not such a large change in lifestyle for them. Unlike, say, mahi-mahi that can thrash to death in confinement, barramundi are used to closed areas with relatively high densities.**¹** What makes them ideal for fish farmers concerned about sustainability is their omnivorous diet. Reducing wild fish content in feed is critical to protecting ocean's ecosystems, but often comes at the cost of producing a farmed fish with low levels of the highly coveted and nutritious omega-3 fatty acids.**³**

Shouting over the whirring generators and water pumps, Daen introduces me to a young man wearing rubber overalls and holding a plastic bucket of feed. He grabs a fistful of the cat-food like pellets and throws them out over the swimming pool-sized tank. The lurking barramundi suddenly appear on the surface in masses, exposing their silver underbellies as the flip their tails and gobble up the feed. He extends the bucket to me, smiling, "Let's make this an interactive tour!" I dive my hand into the bucket and release a handful of the brown kernels into the tank. The surface erupts into a show of splashes, but returns to its level state in just a few seconds.

Feed is one of the most controversial and difficult to manage aspects of aquaculture. Since the advent of modern fishing, humans have become a major predator of small forage fish like herring, anchovies, and capelin. Over 30 million tones -- over one-third of all fish caught in oceans -- are caught annually, and ground up for feed. These fish may be little, but they have a big impact. The collapse of these small fish species is wiping out the larger fish that eat them to survive. If the motivation of aquaculture is to protect wild fish species, we have to ask ourselves - is this a good idea? Aren't there predators more in need of those forage fish than humans?

In the past decade, the aquaculture industry has drastically reduced its Fish-in-Fish-Out (FIFO) ratios, a calculation of the amount of wild fish used to produce the same amount of farmed fish.**²** Australis achieves a FIFO of 1:1 with its barramundi, meaning the company is able to take no more fish from the environment than it produces. This ratio is impressively lower than other predatory fish species and a radical decline from the industry's early aquaculture days when companies struggled to get below a 3:1 or even 5:1 ratio. The Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch awarded Australis the "Best Choice" rating in 2006, a highly coveted marker in the aquaculture industry.

Plus, Australis wouldn't want to eliminate all omega-3 inputs from the feed even if they could. As they say, you are what you eat, so if there are no omega-3s in the feed, there's no omega-3s in the fish. Unlike other species, however, barramundi can be fed a plant-based diet for most of their lives, and if they are given fish feed at the end of their life-cycle, they can synthesize large amounts of omega-3, delivering the same amount of fatty acids as other fish that have fish diets their whole lives. This uncanny ability makes the amount of wild fish needed much lower than in other fish farms.

In addition, the wild fish used in Australis' feed are all rated by Fish Source as sustainable fish feeds. Australis has a policy to not source from any overfished, or depleted sources. Some argue that sustainable sourcing makes the use of wild fish permissible, but Paul Greenberg explained to me that the debate is not so black and white: "Sustainability ratings usually have to do with the stock itself, rather than its ecosystem impacts." This means the fish itself may not be endangered, but catching it in high quantities may deplete the ecosystem it lives in.

As we watched the barramundi settle back into their languid state after the feeding frenzy, Daen continued, "We need to hit a crude protein and crude fat target and do that in a way that doesn't upset the fish' stomach." Switching to vegetarian feeds may be better for oceans, but we have to ask ourselves, can fish actually eat this terrestrial food? If indeed you are what you eat, what effect does it have on them, and their flesh?

Aquaculture 3.0
---------------

Tim o'Shea, the founder of CleanFish, a distributor of sustainable seafood in the Bay Area, and long-time expert on the responsible seafood industry offered a skeptical perspective when we spoke by phone a few days after my visit to Australis, which he had visited himself a few years prior. "If we look at what the barramundi are eating in the wild, they are not eating corn and soybeans. Feed them vegetarian diets and guess what? They don't taste like fish anymore!" This may be stating the obvious, but he is making a larger point. In the same way Josh Goldman set out in search of a fish that naturally is compatible with aquaculture, O'Shea believes we need to look to nature as a model for all aspects of fish rearing. Going one step further, he believes we have a responsibility to respect the patterns of a fish as it lived in the wild, which means not feeding it industrially produced grains.

But for o'Shea, feed is just one drop in an ocean of problems. When I asked if he believed the barramundi could be 'The Fish' we've all been waiting for, he replied, "No, there is no such thing as 'The Fish,' because the mindset and model accompanying it is wrong to begin with." Ever since the 1960s, he explained, aquaculture has transformed into an entirely different model than what it had been for centuries. If we call Aquaculture 1.0 the general fish rearing starting with the legendary perch harvesting in Japanese rice fields, Agriculture 2.0 is the production-maximizing model created post World War II. Essentially, Aquaculture 2.0 is modeled on the efficiencies and monocultures of industrial land farming. While trying to match the Green Revolution with a Blue Revolution, Aquaculture 2.0  ignored natural capital sensibilities of the ocean. Although feed conversion ratios have plummeted in the last decade, aquaculture theorists think that there is a limit to what can be achieved within the agro-industrial framework. "We think we live on Planet Earth," Tim o'Shea said, "but no, we live on Planet Ocean. If the model for growing out farmed fish is based on corn and soybean fields, not the ocean, then we're stuck." We have millennia of knowledge about agriculture, but we are only one generation into Aquaculture 2.0. It's not surprising for o'Shea then, that our first attempt was wrong; it's time to try something else, something more radical than growing Barramundi on corn in tanks. O'Shea wanted me to see Australis not as Aquaculture 3.0, but, at best, Aquaculture 2.0.

Modeling our food systems on nature seems like a logical solution, but what would this actually look like? Isn't this the dilemma we started out with when aquaculture farms were feeding their fish an all fish diet -- precisely what they eat in the wild? Well, Tim o'Shea has thought of that. His concept of "Aquaculture 3.0" sets an even higher bar than even the most sustainable aquaculture operations we have today -- we must go beyond simply not harming the environment; our process must simultaneously restore and regenerate it too.

O'Shea envisions integrated, closed systems that "take less than they give back, recycle waste into food, and use bio-mimicry as a design framework." By emphasizing natural diversity, these systems are able to produce more volume with less waste and create ecosystems that are more fertile and need less inputs each year. This sounds like the Garden of Eden of aquaculture farms, but is it possible? If so, what would it look like?

3D Ocean Farming
----------------

One young man is putting these theories into action. Fisherman turned sustainable shellfish and seaweed farmer, [Bren Smith](https://www.greenwave.org/story) created the first "3D" ocean farm in the country. Rather than farming one type of fish, his 40-acre farm grows a plethora of marine species, ranging from sugar kelp and oysters to mussels and scallops. "Fundamentally, my model is about two things: One, growing environmentally restorative species that mitigate climate change, restore ocean ecosystems and reduce pressure on dwindling fish stocks; and two, re-imagining the role of the fisherman from hunter-gatherer to ocean entrepreneur growing food, fuel, and fertilizer for local communities." The 3D farm's plants and animals exist in synergy, providing the resources for each other in a waste-free, restorative ecosystem. Bren Smith's 3D farm is exciting, but this type of research and development is still in its nascent stages. "It'll take some time but there are many options," says Paul Greenberg.

Businessmen like Daen, however, have to be pragmatists if they want their companies to remain afloat in the world of today, before the promise of Aquaculture 3.0 can be redeemed. He knows that American demand is for affordable, familiar-looking fish, not kelp linguini or kelp ice-cream, as fun as those sounds to me. Although Smith is hoping to replicate his 3D farm across the country and world, the latest research discoveries have yet to be scaled up to the production levels to the likes of Australis.

As Australis' barramundi became increasingly popular in the US, entering chain stores like Whole Foods and Stop & Shop, scaling up was their only option. "In order for barramundi to become the 'next big fish,'" Goldman told *The Global Mail*, "we needed to get those larger, five- to seven --ounce boneless fillets into supermarkets. And we found when we ran the numbers we just couldn't grow the bigger fish we needed in containment and still hit our price point of about US$8.99 a pound in retail." This meant that the 1 million fish I saw in Turner Falls were in fact only a fraction of their total production. In 2007, Australis opened an aquaculture operation in Central Vietnam that departed from the closed-containment model upon which they built their reputation, in exchange for a hybrid system involving marine net-cage farming. In Van Phong Bay, the barramundi spend the first months of their lives in land tanks, similar to those in Turners Falls, but when they are 250g -- about the size of a human hand -- they are transferred to open ocean pens five times as large. Net-cage fish farms used to be frowned upon by the seafood industry, as historically, they were more prone to escapes into the wild environment. Just as Australis was able to shed the negative reputation of feed inefficiencies in fish farming, however, so too are they changing the reputation of marine farming. Their combined land and ocean model limits escapes significantly, as they don't have to transfer fish from one net to another at sea, and also reduces mortality rates and risk of disease. In 2006, the Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch awarded Australis the green "Best Choice" rating for their Turners Fall location, a highly coveted marker in the aquaculture industry, and just in 2014, their Vietnam farm was evaluated and was also awarded "Best Choice," representing the first ever designation in this category for a fish grown in open marine net-pens.

For Australis, the main advantage of having the farm in Vietnam is economical: they can grow bigger fish in open waters to meet the demand for large boneless fillets. Growing fish this large in a closed, land based system would require much more investment that it wouldn't be profitable. As an added benefit, barramundi grown in the ocean taste better. One common issue for aquaculture farms is the 'off flavor,' as it's called, in their fish that results from harmless algae blooms in the tank environment, but creates a muddy taint that humans are extremely sensitive too.

Conclusion
----------

Paul Greenberg ends his Ted talk about fish sustainability innovations with, "This exists kind of on paper," but "it is time to scale this up. If we do, 30 million metric tons of seafood, a third of the world catch, stays in the water." If we want to address both the "Feed the World" and "Save the Ocean" problems, scaling up sustainable solutions is the only way to go. Australis seems to have taken this message to heart, scaling up radically, while maintaining standards of health and sustainability. Bill Shea, the VP of sales at Australis told me in an interview, "The future of seafood is marine farms." But is large scale incompatible with restorative and regenerative farming? O'Shea says Aquaculture 3.0, operates on a "Small is Beautiful scale." For now, the latest research discoveries too new for Australis to adopt at the moment, Daen told me during our tour. That's why Australis is still Aquaculture 2.5 - forward thinking and sustainable, but working within the current model. Is it possible then, to replicate Smith's regenerative model on a global scale without reverting to the failures of the agro-industrial system? Is there a way to combine the models of Goldman and Smith?

Daen told me that Australis isn't just competing against the handful of other barramundi producers, "but also all other white fish, and then all other fish, and then all other proteins. We are competing for stomach share." I set out with a question -- should we eat fish, and if so which one? I don't have a simple answer, but I can tell you that, at the end of the day, we can only eat so much, so we need to be conscious consumers in the fish section. The next generation of fish farming could bring Aquaculture 3.0 -- but that won't happen unless consumers support the innovations of fish farmers by voting with their fork.

**¹** Additionally, Barramundi breed freely through the year and have oversized gills that reduce risk of disease and make them impervious to low oxygen environments. Barramundi have the unique ability to synthesize their own omega-3 from vegetable matter, which is why Australis is able to feed them a mostly vegetarian diet.

**²** This is possible because the FIFO ratio, the amount of wild fish used to produce the same amount of farmed fish, is calculated using a variety of factors besides simply the amount of fish meal and fish oil obtained from wild fish. It also includes, for example, the use of waste products recovered post processing and the fact that some of fishmeal and fish oil inputs are from fish slaughter byproducts, which otherwise would be wasted.

**³** The oil of barramundi is a major selling point for chefs and consumers alike. Barramundi may not be as feed-efficient as purely vegetarian fish, like Tilapia, but that's a tradeoff Australis is willing to make. Consumers used to eating wild-caught sea bass won't switch to tilapia fish sticks simply for environmental reasons, but they may pick barramundi instead. While Tilapia is considered a junk fish with uninspiring omega-3 content and taste, barramundi has a mild, buttery flavor and nutritional value consumers will lay down the bucks for. Australis typically sells barramundi in stores for $8-$10 per pound, and is working to lower that so that it can be an easy and affordable choice for everyone.
