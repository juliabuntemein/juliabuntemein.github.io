What does the grid of the future look like and where are we on our path to achieving it? This blog takes stock of what's been done on both the regulatory and technological fronts, and what else needs to happen.

The grid of the future has three primary characteristics:

(1) restructured, competitive energy markets

(2) powered by clean, distributed, and renewable energy sources

(3) reliable and dynamic

In the United States and Canada, there is a critical need for more robust demand-side energy management and other grid reliability solutions. **Achieving our vision; however, demands more than just technology--- it requires coherent policy and the political willpower to actually realize the infrastructure changes that technologists are already prepared to implement.**

**1\. Restructured, Competitive Energy Markets**

In most states, electric utilities have a [monopoly](https://energywatch-inc.com/regulated-vs-deregulated-electricity-markets/) over regional energy markets. They exercise complete control over all levels of the supply chain, from electricity generation to metering, and are regulated by a public utility commission. Monopoly utilities are vertically integrated, owning generation, transmission, and distribution. Many have a history of abusing their power to influence regulatory decisions and stymie clean energy progress, like when [Arizona Public Service launched an attack](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b6f913085ede1a17e4c2bf7/t/5ba2bb1b21c67c9e611ca509/1537391389069/Breetz+Mildenberger+Stokes+-+2018+-+Political+Logics+Clean+Energy.pdf) on commercial solar development in favor of new fossil gas plants. The main problem with monopoly utilities is that they thwart competition and innovation in the energy space.

The grid of the future has fully competitive wholesale electricity markets administered by Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs). Fully competitive wholesale electricity markets have "restructured" utilities, meaning utilities are vertically disintegrated. **Unlike monopoly utilities that own generation, transmission, and distribution, the electric utility [functions](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/eme801/node/534) mostly as a distribution company while competitive, independent power plants do the generation.** This open market for generation results in the most [cost-effective](https://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Economic-And-Clean-Energy-Benefits-Of-Establishing-A-Southeast-U.S.-Competitive-Wholesale-Electricity-Market_FINAL.pdf) capacity mix and resource allocation.

A restructured, fully competitive energy market is distinct from "retail choice," which is the ability to choose between competitive retail suppliers. It is easy to confuse deregulation with restructuring but the rule of thumb is that both are good, but restructuring is more important. In Montana, for example, customers have retail choice --- they can choose their retail supplier --- but these suppliers aren't purchasing energy from a wholesale energy market.

Even climate-forward states like California, that have an abundance of renewables and green subsidies, have a lot of opportunity to create a more competitive wholesale electricity market. California has implemented ambitious climate policies --- look at the state's [100% zero-emission vehicles](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/09/23/governor-newsom-announces-california-will-phase-out-gasoline-powered-cars-drastically-reduce-demand-for-fossil-fuel-in-californias-fight-against-climate-change/) and [100% zero-carbon electricity](https://focus.senate.ca.gov/sb100/faqs) targets --- but competition in energy generation is far from where it could be. California utilities are still vertically integrated and the state offers retail choice in the form of its [Direct Access](https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/General.aspx?id=7881) program, which permits non-residential customers to purchase energy directly from an Electric Service Provider (ESP), instead of from a regulated electric utility. But participation is granted only to commercial and industrial customers, and is done through an extremely limited lottery with an annual load cap of just 28,762 GWh. Direct Access does very little to reduce investor-owned utilities' control over most of the state.

An important aspect of competitive electricity markets is that they are managed by [RTOs](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/eme801/node/535), non-profit, public-benefit corporations that were created as a part of electricity restructuring in the 1990s. According to Allison Bates-Wannop, Director of Legal and Regulatory Affair at Voltus, there would be an enormous benefit from expanding RTOs to the Southeast and Northwest U.S., where they [don't currently exist](https://www.ferc.gov/power-sales-and-markets/rtos-and-isos), as well as increasing transmission ties between grids for greater import and export capabilities. If the seven Southeastern states share resources to meet capacity needs and co-optimize generation, distribution, and transmission, the region reaps enormous savings. It is projected that creating a competitive southeastern RTO would create a cumulative economic savings of approximately [$384 billion](https://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Economic-And-Clean-Energy-Benefits-Of-Establishing-A-Southeast-U.S.-Competitive-Wholesale-Electricity-Market_FINAL.pdf) by 2040 compared to the business-as-usual case. We have robust data demonstrating the cost-cutting effects of RTOs, as they create the opportunity to transact instead of over-build. Furthermore, RTOs are federally rather than state-regulated, making them even more attractive for the grid of the future, which would benefit from streamlining of regulation and [integration](http://www.eba-net.org/assets/1/6/10-147-184.pdf) of regional electric grids.

**2.** **Powered by Clean, Renewable Resources**

Today's grid remains [far from prepared](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2020/09/30/renewables-wont-save-us-if-the-electric-grid-is-not-ready/?sh=3a84e89d7abf) to accommodate rapidly increasing supplies of renewable energy. Constructed in the early 20th century, America's electric grid was designed for large, fossil fuel-powered plants to deliver stable electricity in one direction, most often to cities. It was not built to support diverse distributed energy resources that produce power at intermittent times, nor delivery of that power to very remote areas.

Over the last decade, policymakers and innovators alike have tended to focus on the production and consumption of renewables, without adequately considering energy distribution. This has resulted in grid limitations undermining ambitious but shortsighted clean energy pledges and renewable energy generation outrunning existing infrastructure. In [Hawaii](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/hawaiis-solar-market-continues-to-struggle-without-net-metering), more energy is produced from solar than can be captured on the grid, resulting in backwards policies prohibiting net metering (although they do offer other forms of [compensation](https://www.notion.so/Market-Matrix-Luke-Walkthrough-c9d81519cf8142fbb2df08383d279f4e?pvs=21)). If this energy could be distributed geographically or stored, In California, Governor Gavin Newson [committed](https://www.hklaw.com/en/insights/publications/2020/09/california-governor-bans-internal-combustion-engines) to phasing out internal combustion engines across the state by 2030, but for this to work, California's grid operators need to take into account the massive spikes and valleys in demand caused by large-scale electric vehicle charging, and CAISO is far from being able to handle that. As of 2022, 35% of [new 2026 car models](https://calmatters.org/environment/2022/08/electric-cars-california-to-phase-out-gas-cars/) sold in California must be zero-emissions, ramping up to 100% in 2035. Powering these vehicles and electrifying other sectors of the economy means the state [must triple its power generation capacity](https://www.energy.ca.gov/publications/2021/2021-sb-100-joint-agency-report-achieving-100-percent-clean-electricity) and deploy new renewables five times faster than the last decade.

**Our grid of the future will be powered fully by renewable energy but we will need better incentives and optimization of variable renewable resources. Restructuring monopoly utilities and extending RTO administration are the first steps to doing that.** A report by Energy Innovation [finds](https://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Economic-And-Clean-Energy-Benefits-Of-Establishing-A-Southeast-U.S.-Competitive-Wholesale-Electricity-Market_FINAL.pdf) that in the Southeast region, where monopolies rely predominantly on existing coal fleets and new gas-fired power plants to meet consumer electricity needs, these utilities "continue to inefficiently plan the power grid at great expense to consumers. Wasted excess capacity leads to wasted consumer dollars while stifling clean energy deployment, employment gains, and public health benefits." [**FERC Order 2222](https://www.ferc.gov/news-events/news/ferc-addresses-demand-response-opt-out-certain-der-aggregations), a landmark decision leveling the playing field for distributed energy resources to compete in wholesale markets, must continue to adapt to the rapidly advancing technology landscape to scale renewables to their full potential today and in the future.**

There are many initiatives to further optimize incorporation of renewables into the grid, such as the creation of energy imbalance markets and extended day ahead markets ([EDAM](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/the-3-key-challenges-to-expanding-the-wests-real-time-energy-market-to-day/578390/)). These initiatives give utilities greater dispatch flexibility to accommodate increased variability, expanding optimized dispatch and delivery from 5% of the power flows in Western electricity markets to almost 100%. Driven by ambitious renewable and zero emissions mandates, Western U.S. states are leading the way in resource optimization and new governance initiatives.

**3\. A Reliable, Dynamic Grid**

The rolling blackouts experienced in states like California and Texas in 2021 were a brutal wake-up call, highlighting the critical need for more robust demand-side energy management and other grid reliability solutions. Capacity markets, where generators commit to providing future energy supply, and weatherization requirements are needed to increase grid resiliency in the event of extreme weather events and unforeseen grid imbalances.

Regulators across many states are rolling out new grid reliability programs, but the efficacy of such programs remains questionable. California's Public Utility Commission recently implemented a new program aimed at preventing a repeat of last August's blackouts, but demand response and DER providers say it is [disappointing](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/californias-latest-demand-side-emergency-plan-takes-heat-from-providers). These actors foresee that the [Emergency Load Reduction Program](https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M369/K286/369286360.PDF) likely won't have the impact it aims to because of opaque MRV and the complex criteria that customers need to meet in order to participate. Registration in these programs is very time-intensive and outdated, with plenty of hoops to jump through. Just because we have the technology doesn't mean the process and structure is there. As ELRP demonstrates, **in order to have demand response really be able to participate in wholesale markets, we need to move away from programs offered by incumbent utilities that can be very prescriptive and slow to change and instead offer direct participation.** All markets need to have market participation models that meaningfully allow all resources to participate, such as what [NYISO](https://www.troutmanenergyreport.com/2020/01/ferc-accepts-nyisos-proposed-aggregation-model-for-ders-and-other-resources/) is beginning to do.

**Conclusion**

Reimagining the grid is imperative in order to accelerate the clean energy transition. The grid of the future will be reliable and dynamic, powered by clean, distributed, and renewable energy sources, and will operate through competitive energy markets. It is an exciting time for for demand-side technologies, as emerging predictive data analytics and storage capabilities make it possible for even greater grid performance. **Achieving our vision; however, demands more than just technology--- it requires coherent policy and the political willpower to actually realize the infrastructure changes that technologists are already prepared to implement.**
