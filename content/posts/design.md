Over the last few weeks, I've gone down a few rabbit holes in the industrial design space. This was driven by a curiosity to understand how architects, designers, and material scientists are thinking about crafting environments valuing 1) environmental sustainability 2) nature-inspired design) and 3) a sense of aliveness that lead to social dynamism and creativity.

I entered this inquiry by learning about carbon-negative building materials. I came across companies using [biochar](https://www.madeofair.com/) and [other agricultural and forestry waste](https://dtematerials.com/) for interior building materials and insulation. Further, there is an enormous field of industrial/ architectural design based on biomimicry, the imitation of natural or biological systems to solve complex human problems. I was inspired by innovators [reducing HVAC needs through termite-inspired ventilation](https://grist.org/article/these-self-cooled-buildings-were-inspired-by-termites-and-frogs/),  [harnessing wind energy using cuttle-fish-inspired locomotion](https://www.undulatech.com/about-1), and [spinning pavilions out of silkworms](https://oxman.com/projects/silk-pavilion-i). These projects range from the purely practical to the mostly aesthetic. My main takeaway around building materials is that there are boundless ways to innovate for sustainability, and looking to nature almost always offers some solution that not only reduces waste, but is also aesthetically striking. Taking the example of the cement manufacturing industry, which accounts for [8%](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/24062022/concrete-is-worse-for-the-climate-than-flying-why-arent-more-people-talking-about-it/) of the worlds C02 emissions, there are entrepreneurs rethinking:

2.  lifetime: self-healing concrete [[Basilisk](https://basiliskconcrete.com/en/)]
3.  composition: cement additives [[Belter Tech](https://beltertech.com/sustainability-2-2/)]
4.  measuring carbon footprint: Marketplace for real-estate developers [[Tangible Materials](https://tangiblematerials.com/)]
5.  AI software for concrete: [[Concret.AI](https://www.concrete.ai/), [AiCrete](https://aicrete.com/), [Carbon Re](https://carbonre.com/), [CarbiCrete](https://carbicrete.com/)]

**Additive Manufacturing**

Through this research on building materials, particularly cement, I discovered an array of literature on the benefits of additive manufacturing. It's a general term for building materials by "adding" instead of "subtracting," which may not be using more sustainable materials but is more resource efficient. There are quite a few advanced software tools, like [Autodesk's Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview?mktvar002=5022374%7CSEM%7C16456115465%7C%7C&mkwid=%7Cpcrid%7C%7Cpkw%7C%7Cpmt%7C%7Cpdv%7Cc%7Cslid%7C%7Cpgrid%7C%7Cptaid%7C%7Cpid%7C&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_campaign&utm_term&utm_content=%7Cpcrid%7C%7Cpkw%7C%7Cpmt%7C%7Cpdv%7Cc%7Cslid%7C%7Cpgrid%7C%7Cptaid%7C%7C&gclid=CjwKCAjwoIqhBhAGEiwArXT7K1ogZCfw3XuS97MH2f8Q_jt7JcA1ZXBaHOgibFRoY7g2gFB1sO48kBoC9pgQAvD_BwE&term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription&plc=F360) that help combine generative design with 3D printing, resulting in products like [lighter planes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giwBpx7tM6I) requiring less jet fuel. There are [startups](https://alloyenterprises.co/) offering 3D printed plastic-part, sheet-metal, and other composite materials that reduce waste and allow for rapid prototyping and precision manufacturing, most often in the aerospace, automotive, industrial, and defense industries. Direct-to-consumer products, however, like 3D printed homes sound cool but they are quite impractical and expensive.

**Industrial Internet of Things**

Reading about generative design/ AI sparked my interest in software innovations that complement industrial design and green buildings more holistically. What's now been termed Industry 4.0, or the "Industrial Internet of Things," marries physical production and operations with smart digital technology, machine learning, and big data. It turns out that there are a lot of software tools radically changing the way companies are designing, constructing, monitoring, and connecting buildings. One start-up called [Maket](https://www.maket.ai/) employs generative design to output building plans in seconds, all cross-checked against lot size, sustainability, building codes, and other parameters. This optimizes and reduces the amount of material needed. We also see companies like [Passive Logic](https://passivelogic.com/) and [Worlds](https://worlds.io/) employing digital twin and simulation models to integrate, coordinate, and automate complex building systems. Along with reducing inefficiencies and unsafe living environments, IoT building software can enable building-to-grid connections that can reduce overall building energy consumption and dynamically turn on/off electronic applications based on renewable energy availability (think battery storage, solar, EV charging, etc.). Partnerships with hardware energy companies like [Span.io](http://span.io/) make a lot of sense here.

**Human-Centered Design**

My father is an architect/ urban designer and my mother is an interior designer so from a young age, I've been spoiled with carefully crafted spaces. One thing my dad taught me is that buildings should respond to and reflect their natural environments. This creates buildings that are not only functional and beautiful but also contribute to the well-being of the dwellers and the community. As I learn about all the latest innovations in the tech sector, I am reminded that we mustn't stray too far from that core principle.

While smart cities, data-driven planning, and algorithmically designed materials may offer efficiencies, conveniences, and cost-saving mechanisms, they are accompanied by risk of over-engineering our spaces. Christopher Alexander, author of the classic text, "The Timeless Way of Building," warns against designing urban spaces around values of order, simplicity, efficiency, and standardization as these principles are directly at odds with nature, which is organic, complex, and arises spontaneously over time.

Building off Alexander's thesis, contemporary anthropologist Shannon Mattern of The New School in New York identifies how data collection, automated design tools, and AI urban planning contributes to homogenization, uninspiring environments, and worse, neglect of what cannot be neatly measured. She writes: "Smart technologies offer convenient, targeted fixes that absolve leaders of the responsibility to investigate and resolve the root causes for health and racial injustices and systemic breakdowns." Her book, "A City is Not a Computer," instead frames a city as an organism and its component buildings and parts are fellow species in our ecosystem. Mattern's and Alexander's texts served as reminders that as innovators in industrial design and green buildings press forward, we must make space for cross-disciplinary conversations that keep our ultimate goals in mind: to make inspiring living environments in which the habitants and the other species/ ecologies surrounding it flourish.
