Attitude really matters. Our current climate crisis is deeply connected to the set of negative beliefs we hold about society. If we believe that human nature is good, and develop compassion for our collective species (which starts with compassion for ourselves), slowing and reversing climate change will be much easier.

**Introduction**

"How did we get to this point?" is a question many of us working on climate ask ourselves, as we take a sobering look at the damage (much irrevocable) our species has wrought on our planet. How have we, collectively, not heeded the signs Earth has given us for decades that we are completely out of balance? A core reason boils down to the fearful, competitive, and antagonistic stance much of our species has developed towards each other over the last ~150 years. The way out of this mess starts with compassion.

Practically, this relates to climate from two angles of behavior change. Firstly, viewing others as essentially good and having a desire to help them will naturally alter our institutions to be more effective and our lifestyles to be less fossil-fuel intensive. When we bring compassion and connectedness to everyone in the world, we will not feel as much striving, coercive, "each man out for himself" drivers that lead to exploitation of resources and each other. I predict that we won't want to eat as much meat, participate in unethical fast fashion, desire as much individual material wealth, or feel as as compelled by unchecked economic growth. Furthermore, our institutions broadly (medical, education, incarceration) will function better with this mindset , leading to less poverty and suffering that drive the competitive, fear response. With time, our ecosystem will restore its natural balance. From this viewpoint, one could argue that what we need is not to convince everyone to work on climate. Rather, we start with our view of human nature and how the world works and everything else will follow, in the climate sector and beyond.

The second angle is the reality-check that, of course, we still need plenty of people to work on climate solutions. Good vibes alone can't counteract the damage we have already done or limit warming to 1.5**Â°**C. Yet our climate efforts will be immeasurably easier if driven by a positive view of human nature. Furthermore, if compassion is driving us to work on climate, it would be completely hypocritical for those values to not be consistent in the other parts of our lives. This applies to how we treat our co-workers, our competitors, and ourselves.

**I. Negative Attitudes of Human Nature**

A society's dominant views on human nature are extremely influential on its institutions and members. Unfortunately, the view on humanity that has dominated the Western world is generally pessimistic, that people are basically bad, selfish, and separate. Just like the placebo effect is extremely effective, its opposite (called the *nocebo effect,* seriously) is equally powerful. If you believe a sugar pill will make you sick, it likely will. If you have negative expectation of someone, your implicit or explicit behavior towards them will have a strong influence on making those expectations a reality. This is called a reinforcing negative feedback loop and is one of the vicious mechanisms that perpetuate racism, patriarchy, individualism, and materialism. Reinforcing feedback loops are so pernicious because they escalate and drain the system's resources, threatening to destroy the system entirely.

II. **Resulting** **Climate Abuse**

So what does this mean for our planet? For 99% of human history, our existence has not posed a dire threat to our planet. Yet, since the Industrial Revolution in the late 1880s, we've been perpetuating reinforcing feedback loops of individualism, materialism, and unchecked growth. These developments significantly improved the lives of most people, but at the cost of our planet. These returns us to my original question of --- how did we get to this point?

The Earth has been giving us signs for decades that she isn't happy or healthy but our striving, coercive, individualist behavior has numbed us to those signals. Driven by underlying fear and disconnecting attitudes, we stopped caring about the planet and instead viewed nature as a set of resources to be converted to human purposes.

III. **Compassion**

As you can see, attitude makes all the difference. If we collectively adopt a view of human nature that is good not evil, collaborative not competitive, trustworthy not selfish, and interconnected not isolated, our behaviors and institutions will change, and as a result, we can restore a way of life on our planet that is harmonious and sustainable. We have a problem with extractive, exploitative behaviors, but the core problem is the mindset. Some people would say that mindset is capitalism, but I'd call it a scarcity mindset. There are good and bad things about capitalism, but the bad things all come from the place of fear.

Historian and author Rutger Bregman explains in his book, [Humankind: A Hopeful History](https://www.notion.so/Solving-the-Climate-Crisis-Starts-with-Self-Compassion-61431539b65a46dab2f69da3ec3fa9bc?pvs=21), that if we shift our paradigms to the knowledge that everyone at their essence, is decent and kind, we can reorganize our institutions to be much more effective in everyone's best interest. He cites the example of Norwegian prison guards who are encouraged to be friendly to the inmates. Norway has one of the lowest recidivism rates among Western countries, at approximately 20%. This is no coincidence. Choosing rehabilitation instead of punishment, compassion instead of separation, works.

What is compassion anyway? I like the simple equation: kindness + suffering = compassion. This equation is meant to remind us of our common humanity. We all experience fear, loss, and pain, and basically want the same thing --- love, joy, and community.


**II. Applications**

So what does this mean, in practice, as we continue to work on solving system problems, such as combatting climate change? As I mentioned in the introduction, I believe that adopting this mindset will change our lifestyles to be less fossil-fuel intensive. Beyond that, there are a few ways in which we can practice value consistency, that I outline below:

1.  Combatting individualism in the tech landscape.

    We must remember that we all have the same goal --- to save our planet (and [ourselves](https://www.oxfamamerica.org/explore/stories/saving-us-an-excerpt-from-katherine-hayhoes-new-book-on-climate-change/)). The mission is not to out-compete the other guy, to raise a Series A, or to IPO. The purpose of building successful climate companies is to scale solutions that really work, as fast as possible. Let's not build companies because of a blind pursuit of economic growth. Capitalist competition is helpful insofar as it is a damn good motivator to make the best possible solutions, as fast as possible!

    We must not alienate anyone, because, again, we are all in this together. This applies to all actors in the climate tech world and beyond. We should thank oil and gas companies for how they served our economies and brought us immense technological conveniences. We can recognize that while their usefulness is coming to an end, their leaders have immense knowledge that can be repurposed.

    Let's avoid judgment and welcome all voices. We must be cautious against the formation of a "climate-elite" that is not representative of all the people who are impacted by climate change. Getting a job in climate-tech, just like any other tech industry, has a lot to do with social signaling and who you know. Let's try to make hiring as equitable, meritocratic, and open-minded as possible. Let's set a radical example of intentional culture setting.

2.  Foreground solutions that have a environmental justice angle.

    Climate change is a social issue, having outsized effects on low-and-moderate income (LMI) and minority communities in Western countries, and disproportionately in lesser developed countries. One example of climate-tech with an environmental justice angle is bringing cost-saving home electrification to those who can benefit the most financially and are also the least shock-resistant to natural disasters. While not every climate-tech product must be specifically directed at these communities, they should at least be consistent with goals of equity and access and values of togetherness and generosity.

3.  Listening to our selves; avoiding burnout.

    It is not selfish to be self-compassionate. Being compassionate to the world means being compassionate to ourselves, as we are members of the world, after all ðŸ˜‰. The golden rule is "treat others the way you want to be treated," but I find "treat ourselves with the kindness we would treat our closest friend or loved one" may be more necessary to hear, as so many of us, myself included, are our own harshest critics.

    Developing self forgiveness, self-compassion, and equanimity in the face of internal turmoil is a gift to all those around us, as we bring those same qualities into our relationships, professional and personal. Maintaining a healthy work-life balance, establishing and upholding boundaries, practicing saying "no," and taking a break from work altogether if necessary, are all consistent in value with a mission to help our planet.


**II. More on Self-Compassion**

> *"The inner devastation of the Western psyche matches exactly the outer devastation it has wrecked upon the planet."* --- Charles Einstein

Author and founder of IFS therapy, Richard Schwartz explains that a negative, distrustful view of humans stems from the same view of our selves. He writes in his book: "The view that people have a sinful, aggressive, selfish, impulsive nature that must be controlled by their rational minds leads to a profound sense of disconnection from other people and disdain for oneself. If everyone is out for themselves, then you should be too... If you believe that your inner nature needs to be monitored, controlled, and if necessary, battled against, then it makes sense that you would see other people that way, and your approach to social problems would invariably involve controlling tactics and war." In order to justify slavery, for example, white Europeans started to differentiate themselves from other "less civilized" cultures ([Schwartz](https://www.amazon.com/No-Bad-Parts-Restoring-Wholeness/dp/1683646681)).

As contemporary author Charles Einstein writes, "The inner devastation of the Western psyche matches exactly the outer devastation it has wrecked upon the planet." Resolving the problems of our outer world will be more easier, even enjoyable, if we simultaneously resolve the problems of our inner world. Jenny Odell, author of *[How To Do Nothing](https://www.notion.so/Solving-the-Climate-Crisis-Starts-with-Self-Compassion-61431539b65a46dab2f69da3ec3fa9bc?pvs=21)*, makes a similar connection between the inner and outer world: "When the logic of capitalist productivity threatens both endangered life and endangered ideas, I see little difference between habitat restoration in the traditional sense and restoring habitats for human thought."

Self-compassion and climate change may seem tenuously connected, at first, but I hope that you can see a little clearer now how 1) attitude is extremely powerful in influencing real outcomes in the world and 2) how we relate to ourselves reflects how we relate to others. The gentle way is the fastest way.
